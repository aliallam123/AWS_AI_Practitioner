# Supervised Learning â€“ AWS AIF-C01 Notes

## What is Supervised Learning?
- Machine learning where the model is trained using **labelled data** (input + correct output).
- Goal: Learn the mapping from input to output to make predictions on new data.

## Common Use Cases
- **Classification**: Predict categories (e.g. spam detection).
- **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g. sales forecasts).

## Key Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Important Points for Exam
- Needs **labelled data**.
- Works well when historical data is available with known outputs.
- AWS SageMaker supports many supervised learning algorithms.
