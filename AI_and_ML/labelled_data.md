# Labelled Data â€“ AWS AIF-C01 Notes

## What is Labelled Data?
- Data that includes both **inputs and their correct outputs** (labels).
- Required for **supervised learning**.

## Examples
- Email text (input) + spam/not spam (label)
- Image (input) + object in the image (label)

## Why It Matters
- Labelled data is essential for training supervised models.
- Better labels = better model accuracy.
- Often expensive and time-consuming to collect.

## AWS Context
- Use **Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth** for data labeling at scale.
- AWS provides tools for **semi-automated labelling** to reduce costs.
