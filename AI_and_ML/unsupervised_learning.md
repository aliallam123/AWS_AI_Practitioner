# Unsupervised Learning â€“ AWS AIF-C01 Notes

## What is Unsupervised Learning?
- ML where the model is trained on **unlabelled data** (no correct outputs).
- Goal: Discover patterns, groupings, or structures in the data.

## Common Use Cases
- **Clustering**: Group similar data points (e.g. customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce number of features (e.g. data visualization).

## Key Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Important Points for Exam
- Does not use labelled data.
- Used in **exploratory data analysis**.
- Useful for pre-processing or understanding large datasets.
- AWS SageMaker includes unsupervised algorithms like PCA and K-means.
