    "### AWS Cloud History\n",
    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched publicly in 2006, initially offering basic infrastructure services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). AWS pioneered the cloud computing industry, becoming the market leader by offering flexible, scalable, and cost-effective computing resources accessible via the internet. Over the years, AWS expanded to include hundreds of services covering computing, storage, databases, machine learning, artificial intelligence, networking, and analytics."
