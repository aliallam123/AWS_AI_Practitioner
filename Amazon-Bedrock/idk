I uploaded the file 'evolution of the internet' and asked the Claude 3.5 Sonnet V1 model "who and when invented the world wide web"

It then searched the internet evolution file and gave me an answer with RAG and Knowledge bases :)

I asked it a random question - how to backflip and because there is nothing about this in the file i uploaded the foundation model cannot give me a response with RAG, it cannot retrieve anything useful because there was no useful info in the knowledge base i gave it
