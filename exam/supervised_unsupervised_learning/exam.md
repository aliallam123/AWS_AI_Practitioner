## 🧠 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning (AWS AI Practitioner)

### ✅ Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Model learns from **labeled data** (input + correct output).
- **Goal**: Predict outcomes for **new, unseen data**.
- **Examples**:
  - 📊 **Sentiment Analysis**: Text labeled as "Positive", "Negative", etc.
  - 🌳 **Decision Trees**: Learn rules from labeled examples.
  - 🧠 **Neural Networks** (when used with labels).

### ✅ Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Model learns from **unlabeled data** (no answers given).
- **Goal**: Find hidden **patterns, groupings, or structure** in data.
- **Examples**:
  - 🧩 **Clustering**: Groups similar customers, products, etc.
  - 🔻 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces features while keeping important info.
