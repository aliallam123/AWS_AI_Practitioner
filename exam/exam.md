I got 60% on a mock paper

I reviewed the questions i got wrong and brushed on these topics:
Asynchronous 

Model metrics such as:
Logistic Regression
SVMs
Neural Networks - big and complex and requires black box model
Decision Trees - If-then model, easy to interpret 

I got 67% on the next mock paper. 

I got 78% on the third mock paper!

70% is a pass

To-do:
book exam

Did the 4th and final mock paper and I got 78% again

Busy today, need to prep for my public speaking tomorrow
